# aoc-2025

Advent of Code 2025 solvers, with some solvers from earlier years as warmup. If you don't know what Advent of Code is, you should go see! It's both lovely, and will help make sense of this repo. :)

https://github.com/barneyb/aoc2017 has an index of all years' repositories.

## Running

The solvers are written in [Johann](https://barneyb.github.io/johann/), one per day. This carries the requirement of `arm64-apple-darwin` (aka Apple Silicon, running macOS), with the command-line dev tools installed.

`make` manages building and acquisition of inputs, via [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data). This carries the requirement of Python 3 installed as well.

Two assumptions must be met for the various `Makefile` to work correctly:

1. a `JOHANN_HOME` environment variable, pointed at a working Johann [installation](https://barneyb.github.io/johann/#the-short-version), and
1. the `advent-of-code-data` package is configured w/ your token.

You can confirm you're set up correctly with these commands (your output will differ):

```
% $JOHANN_HOME/bin/jnc -v
jnc 0.20250622-237b2d0

% aocd 2015 1
()(()((()((((()(((((((() # and ~7,000 more...
```

With that squared away, solve [Not Quite Lisp](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1) (again, your output will differ):

```
% cd 2015/not_quite_lisp_01
% make
~/projects/johann/bin/jnc < not_quite_lisp.jn > target/out/not_quite_lisp.s
gcc -c target/out/not_quite_lisp.s -o target/lib/not_quite_lisp.o
gcc target/lib/not_quite_lisp.o /Users/barneyb/projects/johann/lib/jstdlib.o -o target/bin/not_quite_lisp
aocd 2015 1 | target/bin/not_quite_lisp
Final floor: 321
First descent: 1234
```
